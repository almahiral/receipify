# Receipify

Welcome to Receipify!

Sometimes, choosing what to cook is more complicated than cooking itself. 

So, this app will help everyone break through that confusion and decide for themselves by simply adding the ingredients in your kitchen and scanning your grocery receipts. 

This app will enable users to access recipes catered specifically for them using AI which will recommend recipes based on the users tastes and ingredients they currently have access to, the users can also store the receipts in a library and go back to them later on.
